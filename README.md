# WeatherPy

## Overview of the project

First, I created 2000 random cities and using openweather map api managed to create a dataframe with the needed columns such as maximum temperature, latitude and etc. Then, the client specified us a given temperature, so that I could find hotels based on his temperature criteria and created a google map heatmap with markers displaying the hotel names,cities and their weather.Finally, I created a itinerary by displaying the travel route in google maps for the client.
